                Elewa is a mission-driven organization. We make <br>
                use of our cooperative and shared culture to drive <br>
                the needle for the development of people and our <br>
                environment. We care for our own, but also care <br>
                deeply about the context surrounding us.

                Our investments are therefore not limited to <br>
                internal ones but contribute heavily to our <br>
                community and environment. From training the <br>
                next scout leaders on sustainable practices, to <br>
                bridging the employment gap for junior software <br>
                developers.
